FolloMusic
==========

This document serves as a readme for the FolloMusic application.

FolloMusic is a music oriented Social Network on the Android platform where people can follow music activity of friends in real time, allowing every user to act as a miniature radio DJ.
Similar to Last.fm Scrobbling service, it gathers statistics of the listening history of users and derives meaningful popularity trends in the contextual friend circle ( In development mode)

The application does not require any explicit user registration, the only pre-requisite is a valid unique phone number. Relying on android contacts, the friend circle of a user is populated.
Employs use of Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) for device communication and a backend PHP webservice for data transmission.


NOTE: 
The application is still in development mode. Please see the list of open issues on the undergoing features/bugs
